I've created this repo for testing purposed. It's quite fancy, no?

Although it's fancy, I feel like it's lacking things.

Did I write that earlier? If so, I don't recall that. PR test

branch name test
wafflebot, are you back from vacation? 
making a change to test this thing. writing lots of stuff so it seems like a novel. it's fun. seriously, writing a bunch of words with no story or purpose, it's kinda nice. you should try it. 
testing this stuff. still writing a long novel, it's pretty great. there's no beginning or end, mostly just middle stuff.

why is the spacing so weird on this? yesh. 
branch test again
