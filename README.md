I've created this repo for testing purposed. It's quite fancy, no?

Although it's fancy, I feel like it's lacking things.

Did I write that earlier? If so, I don't recall that. PR test
nother pr test. nother
does that work? 
that pr is being tested too
branch name test
wafflebot, are you back from vacation? 
making a change to test this thing. writing lots of stuff so it seems like a novel. it's fun. seriously, writing a bunch of words with no story or purpose, it's kinda nice. you should try it. 
testing this stuff. still writing a long novel, it's pretty great. there's no beginning or end, mostly just middle stuff.

why is the spacing so weird on this? yesh. 
branch test again
on this line
testing branch things here
that is a test also. branches are parts of trees. this will test the branches too. last test of the day. well maybe just last test of the hour. 
new day, new test! ok one more. let's test this one again. why doesn't that login thing go away? 

this feels like a short novel. that's ok though. that didn't save.. where did the tab thing go I saved? why oh why do I keep testing this? WHY
oops really messed up that test
test test test
oh there's that stuff i was looking for. tis here. how's about dis?
